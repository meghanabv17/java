<h><b><i>The four different ways that snakes move are serpentine locomotion, “concertina” locomotion, “caterpillar” or “rectilinear” locomotion, and sidewinding locomotion.Parrots, also known as psittacine are birds with a strong curved beak, upright stance, and clawed feet</b></i></h>
<i>Snakes have no external ears, but they retain a few vestiges of an internal ear, which are connected to other skull bones in such a way as to permit the transmission of some earth-borne, and perhaps a few aerial, sound waves of low frequency.</i>
